# CQS-site
Cool Queue Studios website

This project was created as a learning tool for GITHUB and a refresher on GIT. (I was usung GIT / STASH a couple of years ago at MedImpact).
(All of CQS code for our site, Galactic Domination tool sets, server code, and game-web interface as well as our design and project documentation already exists in TortoiseSVN)

The php here is largely wordpress generatated and serves only as an example. Nothing worth seeing here.
